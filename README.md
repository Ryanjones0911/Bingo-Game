This is just the final project for Programming 2 at LoneStar College. I'm only putting it on GitHub because it has some concepts (passing array pointers to functions &
dynamic arrays, for instance) that I don't want to lose my reference examples for. As for functionality, it's just a simple little 2 player bingo game that runs in the console.
Y'know, nothing too crazy.
